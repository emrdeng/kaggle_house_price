# Kaggle House Prices Predictor Competition

Developed an advanced predictive model for the Kaggle House Price competition, achieving an impressive 85% accuracy rate on the test data. This repository showcases the machine learning techniques employed, including feature engineering, cross-validation, and data visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. Explore the code and notebooks to gain insights into the model development process and leverage the implemented strategies for your own predictive modeling tasks.

# About the Competition

If you want additional details on the competition, refer to: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview.

This Kaggle competition provides a training data set of 1,400+ data points with 79 features to analyze and develop a model to predict the house prices. The competition also provides a testing data set of another 1,400+ data points (without the target sale price).

Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. As a student diving into machine learning, I was pleasantly excited that I achieved an 85% accuracy rate on the test data with my model (here's my trophy to prove my accuracy):

There has been over 24,000+ entries into this competition since it started and although there is room for improvement, I was fairly certain I was headed in the right direction for future re-entries as I attempt to improve this model so that it is closer to a 90% accuracy score.

Note that I was #2,945 on the public leaderboard on the day of my first-ever submission (I will posts future branches as I continue to improve on this!):
